# **MyDigitalClock_C**

**MyDigitalClock_C** is a console-based digital clock implemented in the C programming language. It allows users to input the initial time and continuously updates and displays the current time in a visually appealing format. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts, real-time clock functionality, and console-based UI design.

## **About the Project**
This project was created as a hands-on way to explore the C programming language. **MyDigitalClock_C** is designed to:
- Showcase fundamental programming skills, including loops, conditional statements, and functions.
- Provide a clean and user-friendly console interface.
- Serve as a practical example of real-time functionality using system-level libraries.

## **Features**
- Displays time in the `HH:MM:SS` format with automatic updates every second.
- Allows users to set the initial time manually.
- Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface.
- Written with cross-platform functionality (tested on Windows).
- Infinite loop for continuous clock display until terminated manually.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: C
- **Libraries**: 
  - `<stdio.h>`: For input/output operations.
  - `<stdlib.h>`: For system commands.
  - `<windows.h>`: For real-time clock functionality on Windows.
- **Platform**: Windows (supports other platforms with slight modifications).
